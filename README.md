# COSC-121-Project
In addition to lab assignments and exercises, you will also work on a project of developing part of a farming game similar to FarmVille. Our game is called Teeny-Tiny Farm. The project will be detailed during class time and guidance will be provided by both the instructor and TAs. Labs will decompose this large problem into smaller ones manageable by students. As the semester advances, less guidance will be provided and students will be more and more expected to come up with their own design.
We will not write the code for the graphical interface or all game dynamics. Instead, you will develop the underlying design and class structure. When your code is used within the game, the output would look like the screenshot below (also, see the video file demo.mp4 that is posted on Canvas).
